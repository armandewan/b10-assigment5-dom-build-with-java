        <span>The Document Object Model DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of the document as a tree of objects, allowing you to manipulate its content and visual presentation. Each object represents a part of the document, such as an element or attribute. </span>

        <p class="font-bold">What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and it is useful?</p>
        <span>Event delegation in JavaScript is a pattern that efficiently handles events. Events can be added to a parent element instead of adding to every single element. It refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. This can be done on a particular target element using the .target property of an event object. </span>
